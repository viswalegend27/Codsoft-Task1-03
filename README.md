For this code to work you need install the emailjs command
----> npm install @emailjs/browser 
After that you need to install the emailjs to execute the email messaging feature of the emailjs 
Create an account in your emailjs
and modify the following code below in your scripts.js

/*(function() {
  emailjs.init("YOUR CLIENT ID");
})();*/

/*
      emailjs.send("YOUR SERVICE ID", "YOUR TEMPLATE ID", {
          from_name: name,
          from_email: email,
          message: message
      })
*/
